# GreenhouseSimulation
A Simulation Model for greenhouse inner climate
The model is mainly based on:
Vanthoor, B. H. E., et al. "A methodology for model-based greenhouse design: Part 1, a greenhouse climate model for a broad range of designs and climates." Biosystems Engineering 110.4 (2011): 363-377.
